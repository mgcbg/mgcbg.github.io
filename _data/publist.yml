- title: "SMIM1 at a glance; discovery, genetic basis, recent progress and perspectives"
  image: smimi.png
  description: Recent elucidation of the genetic basis of the Vel blood group system has offered the field of blood transfusion medicine an additional consideration in determining the causes of hemolytic reactions after a patient is transfused. The identification of the SMIM1 gene to be responsible for the Vel blood group allows molecular based tools to be developed to further dissect the function of this antigen. Genetic signatures such as the homozygous 17 bp deletion and the heterozygous 17 bp deletion in combination with other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion sequences regulate the expression level of the gene. With this knowledge, it is now possible to study this antigen in-depth.

- title: "P. falciparum strains spontaneously switch invasion phenotype in sus. culture"
  image: switchphen.png
  description: P. falciparum strains Dd2 and W2mef have been shown to change from sialic acid (SA)-dependent to SA-independent phenotypes when selected on neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes. Following an observation of increasing ability of Dd2 to invade neuraminidase-treated cells when cultured for weeks, we compared invasion phenotypes of Dd2, W2mef and 3D7 strains of Pf that were cultured with suspended or static. While Static Dd2 and W2mef remained SA-dependent for the entire duration of the investigation, Suspended parasites spontaneously and progressively switched to SA-independent phenotype from week 2 onwards. Our data demonstrates a novel mechanism for inducing the switching of invasion pathways in Pf parasites.

- title: "Local diagnostics kits for Africa being developed in Ghana"
  image: dummy.png
  description: In our view, building local capacity in diagnostics could help Africa to tackle diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. We have set up a unit to design and develop diagnostic kits at the University of Ghana’s West African Centre for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens (WACCBIP). A robust service to monitor public health and deliver treatment depends on reliable early diagnosis of medical conditions. Africa is generally very limited in its development and deployment of diagnostics systems, however, so these are mostly brought in at high cost from the developed world. Furthermore, the stability and usability of such sensing systems are hampered by poor storage conditions and inadequately trained personnel. Using local platforms such as ours for developing diagnostic sensors and instrumentation will help to meet the continent’s growing demand for them. The hope is that ill health will no longer impede the economic prospects of the continent.

- title: "Antimalarial activity of Malaria Box compounds against P. falciparum clinical isolates"
  image: malbox.png
  description: Malaria remains a major cause of childhood deaths in resource-limited settings. In the absence of an effective vaccine, drugs and other interventions have played very significant roles in combating the scourge of malaria. The recent reports of resistance to artemisinin necessitate the need for new antimalarial drugs with novel mechanisms of action. Towards the development of new, affordable and easily accessible antimalarial drugs for endemic regions, the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) assembled a total of 400 active antimalarial compounds called the Malaria Box. The potency and the efficacy of the Malaria Box Compounds have been determined mainly using laboratory strains of P. falciparum.
